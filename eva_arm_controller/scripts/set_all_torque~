'''
To set torque enable or disable all at once.

To enable torque
   python set_all_torque 1
To desable torque
   python set_all_torque 0

If the packets are missing in some servos in the first run , Then run it multiple times

It uses the service /'joint_name'/torque_enable corresponding to individual dynamixels.
